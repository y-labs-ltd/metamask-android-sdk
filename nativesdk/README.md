# MetaMask Android SDK Native Module

## Overview
The MetaMask Android SDK Native Module is a Kotlin [Android Native Module](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android) embedded in the MetaMask wallet that acts as the server-side of the [Inter Process Communication (IPC)](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/processes-and-threads#IPC) between the MetaMask SDK in the Android dapps and the MetaMask wallet. The IPC mechanism is implemented using the [Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL)](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl).

This module handles encrypted communication between the dapp and MetaMask and then relays the messages over to the Android SDK communication layer implemented in React Native in the wallet. The wallet calls the Native Module via  NativeModules - an API that enables react-native code to call native Kotlin primitives.

## Compiling
To compile the nativesdk as a `.aar` file, you need to modify the project's `settings.gradle` file to have the nativesdk as a standalone module to include to the project:
```
include ':app'
include ':nativesdk'
include ':metamask-android-sdk'
```
Then run
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
The output file will be located in `nativesdk/build/outputs/aar`. This nativesdk library is then embedded in the MetaMask mobile in the path `android/libs/nativesdk.aar`. It becomes the server-side component of the AIDL communication mechanism described below in the Architecture section.

## Architecture
The client SDK communicates with the server SDK (Android Native Module) via IPC implemented using AIDL. 

### Dapp <-> MetaMask Inter-app Communication
This happens over AIDL IPC. The communication over the IPC protocol is entirely encrypted using Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption (ECIES). We cross-compiled the rust version of the [ecies.org](https://ecies.org/) implementation. More information on the mechanics of this encryption can be found in the
[Official MetaMask SDK documentation ](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/concepts/sdk/#communication-layer).

### Native Module <-> React Communication
Within MetaMask, the communication from the native module to React Native happens via message broadcast, while that from React Native to the native module happens via `NativeModules` -  a React Native API that enables react native code to call mobile native primitives (Kotlin).

The architectural diagram of the communication is illustrated below
